                <h6>Why did you create HustleCase?</h6>
                <p>When you want to capture a quick sketch, we recommend using an app called Microsoft Office Lens that
                    has
                    a whiteboard setting to capture photos.</p>

                <h6>Is it only for Macs?</h6>
                <p>The hard shell cases are only for Macs at the moment. We are working on adding more laptops types
                    soon.

                <h6>How durable is the case?</h6>
                <p>The cases are made of plastic, making it durable enough to protect your laptop from bumps and
                    scratches,
                    but light and breathable enough to release heat.</p>

                <h6>Is it hard to erase?</h6>
                <p>Our dry-erase surface has been designed to be scratch resistant, easy to write on and even easier to
                    wipe.</p>

                <h6>How do I record my sketches?</h6>
                <p>As freelance designers, we found our office being wherever our laptop was. We wanted an accesible
                    whiteboard to save time and paper and created the HustleCase!</p>
